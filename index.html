                  Suzy's leadership coaching has been a transformational experience for both of us. She's helped us create an exceptionally strong foundation
                  within our Co-Founder partnership &mdash; guiding us to see where our individual strengths
                  lie, whilst also recognising how we complement one another. We feel that the work we've done will help us to weather any inevitable
                  future storms and grow in a way that sees us both working at our best.<strong>”</strong>

                  <strong>“ </strong>
                  Suzy worked with me when I was going through a period of real change in my
                  professional
                  life. I had just taken on a new role which was both demanding and high profile. Suzy
                  brought a real wealth of experience, and her style is both calming and reassuring in
                  equal measure. She is an informed, capable coach and very likeable on a personal
                  level. I would have no hesitancy in recommending her.<strong>”</strong>
