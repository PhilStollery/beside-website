              <p>You’re already highly skilled and experienced at what you do, however you may be feeling there’s

              <p>With a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between strategy and culture, I offer CEOs,
                and/or HR Leaders, invaluable insights into bridging culture gaps within their organisations.
              </p>
              <p>It's more than how employees perceive their workplace or, how employers attract and retain talent.
                Culture is evolving into an externally facing asset or potential liability.
              </p>
              <p> Culture can either bolster, or impede, the delivery of organisational strategy. As leaders create,
                cultivate and nurture it, culture can become a potent competitive advantage.
              </p>
              <p> My approach involves a culture assessment with tailored strategies, and pragmatic interventions, to
                evolve and close the gaps.

              </p>
              <p>Whether you’re seeking specific interventions, ongoing mentoring, or sweeping cultural transformations,
                I fully immerse myself beside you offering a fresh perspective facilitating meaningful change and
                sustainable impact.

                  Suzy is a highly professional and warm coach who creates an open environment to
                  explore vulnerabilities, thoughts, emotions, and ideas which helped me navigate ways
                  forward. I have benefited heavily from her thoughtful and astute questioning which
                  created very positive changes in me personally and within my role.

                  I had the chance to work with Suzy when I was at a crossroads in my career and had
                  recently taken a new role. Our division had just been sold to another company and
                  was going through unprecedented changes. Rationally, I knew this whole situation
                  presented a unique opportunity for professional development. Emotionally, I felt
                  insecure. I feel I have grown significantly in my new role and there is no doubt in
                  my mind that Suzy, in the way she was engaged in our coaching sessions, has played a
                  significant role in that growth. She just has this talent to bring out the best in
                  people.

                  to identify ways I could strengthen relationships with people with different styles
                  of working to myself whilst developing different ways of thinking and operating.

                  We feel extremely fortunate to have had Suzy's leadership coaching during a period

                  within our Co-Founder partnership - guiding us to see where our individual strengths
                  lie, whilst also recognising how we complement one another. It really has been such
                  a joy, and we feel that the work we've done will help us to weather any inevitable
                  future storms and grow in a way that sees us both working at our best. It really has
                  been a transformational experience for both of us.

                  brought a real wealth of experience, and her style is both calming and reassuring in
                  equal measure. She is an informed, capable coach and very likeable on a personal
